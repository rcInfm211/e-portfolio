*Apply technology informatics skills to solve specific industry data and information management problems, with a focus on usability and designing for users;*

## Interpretation

Informatics is a data-driven field focusing on human-user interaction through computer technologies (Kaltenbacher, 2019). It generates applications that are enhanced with tools and techniques from fields such as; communication, mathematics, multimedia, and human-computer interaction design, with a strong focus on the human use of computing (Indiana University, 2020). Competency A embodies the definition of informatics through its use of knowledge, and technical information systems to create rich computer applications that manages an organization’s data requirements. It involves specifying a problem, framing a solution, investigating the digital data schema for informational storage, and creating prototypes that allows for profound user interactions. Competency A means to synthesize useful solutions that connects people, with various levels of knowledge, to technical information systems with usable interfaces that assists in an organization’s core mission (Benoit, 2019). The most successful organizations are the ones with the most useful and actionable information at hand (McKnight, 2014).

Competency A, to me as a professional, means to work closely with an organization, or individual, to achieve their information-based goals inside of the digital realm. Companies are allocating their resources selectively to customers, products and processes for information management (McKnight, 2014). Competency A means that you need to architect the environment in a way that encourages data use by making it well-performing by putting up the architectured data and having minimal impact on users, and budgets for ongoing maintenance (McKnight, 2014). It is about understanding how people will live, and thrive in a digital space, with an elegance of design that makes sense to those who use differing particular technologies (Indiana University, 2020).

Informatics is an interdisciplinary field that not only analyzes data, but makes it actionable for many different users in vast subjects (Kaltenbacher, 2019). It is crucial to work with businesses in affirming the problems with its data, and information through the design of management systems with the user interaction in mind. Competency A is quintessential to the data process, by definition, because it aligns with the  professional responsibilities of an informaticist. The informaticist duties are; managing data, making that data useful, and making data accessible for users within an organizations in order to achieve its operational purposes (Kaltenbacher, 2019).

I created a novel data management solution, at my job, for the Stanford’s School of Earth. One petabyte of user records needed to be backed up to a remote server on campus, but the user permissions to that data could not be saved to the new location due to technological constraints. I had to; frame the problem, work with other consultants at the department, design a data schema for the many permissions of many files, create a database to this metadata and then generate an interface to simplify administration of it. The focus on bridging the differing fields with usability in mind while assisting the organization’s mission of research conveys competency a to the fullest.

My course work in Informatics Technology Fundamentals has allowed me to fully participate in competency A's attributes. The lessons within this class has taught me how to create unique interfaces to address usability, and determine the correct data requirements for an organization when addressing their problems at hand. My project at work, and my course work has allowed me to fully utilize all of the core components of competency a.

## Supporting Evidence

I have gathered two pieces of evidence that displays my knowledge of Competency A. One piece of evidence supports the data, and information management needs while the other addresses the usability aspect of competency a.

### INFM 201 – Informatics Technology Fundamentals – Final Project – Link 

I chose this project because it highlights the data, and information management needs of competency a. I started the project by understanding the needs of a hypothetical hospital’s library and archive that have lots of donated materials to put in a virtual museum. I processed the schema to the data by identifying the needs of the organization and bridging it to a database and user interface. The schema not only built foundations on the data types needed, but how the size of each data element as well. Its probably the best piece of evidence to display the data, and information component of competency a.


### INFM 201 – Informatics Technology Fundamentals – Lab 4 – Link 

I chose lab 4 because it directly addresses the usability aspect of component a. The lab consisted of inspecting the Los Angeles county’s web page and determining how the interface could be improved. This involved investigating the links to the page, the sub-pages, creating a wire frame interface of the improved prototype, and constructing the data elements that were to be placed upon the page. Afterwards a link to the proposed interface was hosted on a San Jose State web server. Its a very in depth way of participating in the usability aspect of competency a.

## Conclusion

This competency has taught me that data management and usability are one in the same. My experience at work, and through my lessons have taught me that it could be impossible to manage data if it is not usable. Increasingly advanced levels of information are permeating every company, every job, and every day (McKnight, 2014). It is ever important for an informaticist to convene and bridge the vast world to data. I am able to better asses the needs of a business and create solutions based on a user profile, the data needs, and the information management due to my coursework.
