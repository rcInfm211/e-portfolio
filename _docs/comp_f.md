# Competency F

###### tags: `e-portfolio` `competency f` `Randall White`

*Conduct informatics analysis and visualization applied to different real-world fields, such as health science and sports.*

## Interpretation

Informatics is a data-driven field that involves turning data into information, then making it useful and accessible for users within organizations to achieve optimal operations (Kaltenbacher, 2019). Professionals often tap into complex data when making important decisions for the mission of an organization, and its resources (University of Illinois, 2020). It has become increasingly important for informatics professionals to share their data analysis through cutting edge visualizations. Competency F is the process of humanizing data. It takes unstructured, structured, and semi-structured data and creates a format that the eyes can easily digest. Visualizing data allows informatics experts to present key trends and information via; graphs, charts, tables, info graphics, maps, time lines, and other visuals that convey rich knowledge (University of Illinois, 2020). Organizations can synthesize raw data and convert it into graphics, and dashboards in order to offers a clear solution to hard decisions (University of Illinois, 2020). 

Competency F, to me, means to conduct analysis and visualization in different fields by using modern computational notebooks. Computational notebook are specialized digital documents that allows researchers to combine data with analysis, software code, hypotheses and conjecture, computational output, explanatory text, along with rich multimedia resources embedded inside a single document (Perkel, 2018). It is a form of interactive computing. An environment in which users execute code, see what happens, modify and repeat in a kind of iterative conversation between researcher and data (Perkel, 2018). Conducting analysis in informatics should require computational notebooks to allow rich dashboards, visualizations, and interactivity. Notebooks can be applied to many different fields too, which makes it essential to Competency F.

Informatics is a vast science that converts information to a format that allows grandiose insights to success (Kaltenbacher, 2019). It has a requirement of building from and producing information-based compositions from a variety of formats like; digital documents, audio, video, social media platforms and other forms of content (Kaltenbacher, 2019). Informaticists need to enhance the understanding of data, from different fields, through the use of exploratory data analysis and lush visualizations. Visualizations are the key to better decisions inside of organizations, and the reason that Competency F is undoubted in the strength it brings to informatics in general. 

As a professional I’ve had to generate a plethora of visualizations and dashboards, from data analysis, to convey information to my shareholders about the research that I partook in. When I worked at Lawrence Berkeley National Labs, as a research assistant, it was important that I created great visuals for interpreting our simulation data. I designed x-y plotting charts, heat maps, word clouds, and interactive vertex graphs to convey the data from mathematical functions, and natural language processing from published scientific articles. I practiced the themes of competency F with that project quite thoroughly. It was pretty much impossible for a person to interpret that information, without the visualizations, and this is why competency f is immensely important.  

My coursework in Health Data and Analytics assisted me in fully participating in the attributes of competency f. My Big Data Analytics and Management class also allowed me to fully realize my mastery of the competency. I created a use case document, in Health Data and Analytics, where I designed a health project that monitored HIV rates in the Atlanta metropolitan area by using secondary hospital data. I was able to scheme out the analysis phase, along with the visualization phase of the project- through the use of the Plotly software suite of data visualization tool sets. I worked in a team project, in Big Data Analytics and Management, where I conducted time-series based statistical analysis on Covid-19 data, and then generated some graphs in order to convey what exactly the disease is going to do to our economy. Both of these classes helped me demonstrate competency f's focus on analysis and visualization applied to the health science field. 


## Supporting Evidence

I have gathered two pieces of evidence that shows my mastery of Competency F. One describes a use case for an analysis and visualization project, while the other is a report where the analysis and visualization component of Competency F was conducted.

### INFM 214 – Health Data and Analytics – Final Project: Use Case Video – Link

This is a video document that I created in presenting the use case of a health informatics project that monitored AIDS/HIV infection rates in the Atlanta metro area in the state of Georgia. It described how the analysis would take place, and also how the visualization would be enacted- all through a project plan. The presentation itself features some analysis and visualizations to accompany the use case scenario. The video itself is also a form of data visualization that coincides with the meaning of competency f. It compliments the competency in multiple aspects.

### INFM 203 – Big Data Analytics and Management – Mini Project Report – Link

This piece of evidence was a group final project where I was tasked with doing statistical time series analysis on Covid-19 death rates in correlation to the economy. First I cleaned the data sets, and then analyzed them using a moving average, and forecast modeling. I afterwards created graphs of the data and presented it to our group during a stand up meeting in the week. We then collaborated using Google docs to place the graphs on our final report, and we then used the graphs to place it in our presentation built from Canva. This feat fits entirely into the specifications of competency e, and it brought a lot of awareness of how devastating Covid-19 was going to be to our society.

## Conclusion

Competency F is a powerful way, in informatics, to share much needed information swiftly and effectively (University of Illinois, 2020). Humans are intimately visual creatures. Our eyes have evolved significantly to the point where we have to see it to believe it for validation. Parsing through terse digitized texts leaves us no where in our quest to interpolate facts. Informaticists need to know that visualizations should be key for all different types of data analysis. It would only be a wasted to not venture in creating interactive graphics that tell a story through the information presented. Visualizing data opens significant avenues to educate and empower doctors, executives, and the public at large (University of Illinois, 2020). Competency F should not be taken lightly.
