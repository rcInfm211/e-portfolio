*Evaluate, manage, and develop electronic records programs and applications in a specific organizational setting;*

## Interpretation

Informatics requires pristine information management. This ensures that access and use is enabled for stakeholders to make informed choices regarding technology and software tools for the production of information-driven solutions while encouraging an organization’s objectives in a secure and reasonable manner (Kaltenbacher, 2019). Competency B means to create, manage and judge electronic records, and rich applications that encircle specific organizational settings. Competency B describes a content management system known as digital asset management. A digital asset management system is a central trove of information that allows organizations to easily store, organize, find, manage, distribute, and analyze their digital content (Brandfolder, 2019). It is a convergence of previous library based asset management and digital rich media. Digital asset management systems can support strategic organizational initiatives, reduce costs, generate new revenue opportunities and  improve collaboration and streamline workflow, provide better brand management, enable marketing agility and operational excellence. The foundation of competency b, for electronic records, is an asset to any organizational type and setting.

Competency B, to me, means metadata. Metadata is simply information that describes other data, and is the most important aspect of a digital asset management system. Metadata tables, created in database management systems, are used in many aspect: They point to digital media that cannot be contained inside of a database, they are used to bring context to media sources that might not have any, they are used to make searches much more efficient and easier, and they allow the use of identifying patent holders in the realms of its digital rights management. 

As an informaticist it is pertinent that you create, and conform electronic records to the requirements of an organization. The reliability, integrity, and authenticity are important factors for electronic records. Jason Kaltenbacher of San Jose State’s School of Information states; “The reliability of an electronic record validates the record’s trustworthiness as evidence” (Kaltenbacher, 2019). Kaltenbacher (2019) also mentions that integrity emphasizes the use of metadata for tracking the creation, use as well as alteration to records and authenticity encapsulates both reliability and integrity of an electronic record proving that the record hasn’t been changed or altered. Competency B manifests the itself through the use of metadata to create a corner stone foundation for informatics that every practitioner should be aware of.

In my professional career I’ve had to create many systems to manage electronic records with computer applications. For example when I was a research assistant at Lawrence Berkeley Labs I created a simulation software that needed to keep track of different electronic records stored on many file systems. I was able to create a metadata schema inside of the application to generate a form of digital asset management. This allowed me to easily evaluate the records and manage them in conjunction with the application that I had developed. This experience corresponds with the very essence of competency b.  

Digital Asset Management and Electronic Records Foundations are the two courses that assisted me the most in evaluating the themes of competency b. In both courses I evaluated and managed electronic records for specific organizational needs. In one of the classes I even developed a functioning application with the electronic records I created.

## Supporting Evidence

I have gathered two pieces of evidence that displays my knowledge of Competency B. Both pieces of evidence overlap when it comes to evaluating and managing electronic records. Only one has an application that was designed for use within a hypothetical organization.


### INFM 207 – Digital Asset Management – Project 2 – Link

I created a DAM system for a hypothetical video game company in the second project for my Digital Asset Management class. I evaluated the company's needs and designed the primary metadata schema that was based upon the standards defined by Schema.org. I filled it with convincing dummy data, and framed a project requirements document for an interface to manage the data. I was able to evaluate the company's needs, develop the DAM according to these needs and frame an application interface to manage it as well.

### INFM 206 – Electronic Records Foundations – Project Part 2 – Link

I created a project called MyHealthUHN, for my Electronic Records Foundations class. This project was for the hypothetical University Health Network organization, to embrace big data through secondary data use of electronic health records by allowing hospital patients to take surveys that would compliment their health data through statistical analysis. I evaluated the needs for survey sampling in secondary data use, and made a project plan that focuses grid computing infrastructure, in that many computers run the database software and sync with each other. I also developed the metadata schema to store these survey records, and a web based application that served dual purposes; to manage the data


## Conclusion

Electronic records, unlike paper documents, require considerable management and intervention to ensure long-term access (Kaltenbacher, 2019). Yet it is definitely worth it. When users find it easier to locate their organized information, when needed, it aids in their own responsibilities and collaborative efforts (Kaltenbacher, 2019). The return on investment through managing these records can be had obtained through cost reductions. New revenue opportunities can be realized by designing applications that traverse organized data, and metadata in an efficient manner. A DAM system can give an organization a competitive edge against their competitors. The types of technology that can be used also vast.  Expert systems, wearable technologies, smartphone apps and more flourish with intuitive user focused designs, and managed electronic records. That is what competency b stands for.
