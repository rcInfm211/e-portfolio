*Identify user needs, ideate informatics products and services, prototype new concepts, and evaluate a prototype’s usability;*

## Interpretation

Informatics requires designing user interfaces by studying the human computer interaction based upon the needs of users, and organizations. Competency D is the execution of creating a human computer interface by; addressing the requirements and needs, designing a low functioning prototype, developing a high functioning prototype, and then evaluating usability metrics of how an individual or organization uses the interface. Every product has to have some form of a user interface in order to express their needs. A broom has its the broomstick has user interface, a cup has its handle, the touch screen for a mobile phone, along with the screen, keyboard and mouse for a computer are all part of the interface for a user (Heimgärtner, 2019).  It is pertinent to implement our knowledge of; human characteristics, cognition, social behavior, organizational behavior, physiological, and neurological characteristics to create interfaces that fit the requirement of real users (Moallem, 2019).

Competency D, to me, means that careful observations and design needs to take place in order to create interfaces that address: Effectiveness, efficiency, satisfaction and functionality. Effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction means that users can achieve their tasks in a specific environment (Moallem, 2019). Functionality is what needs an informatics application can do for a user which must match their needs, or else users will reject and underutilized the product (Moallem, 2019). Competency D is important to me as a professional because if users at my organization cannot utilize the data driven resources properly, they will not use it all. If our users do not utilize our resources, it hampers the mission of the organization. 

Informatics is a field that focuses on data intertwined with human user interaction for information systems. The fact that the field focuses on user centered systems means that an informaticist must create products with user requirements idealized in its effectiveness and functionality. Informaticists need to be deeply committed to enhancing the user experience, which strengthens their resolve when they face difficult choices, time pressures, and tight budgets (Moallem, 2019). An informaticist must also have a thorough understanding of the diverse community of users and the tasks that must be accomplished (Moallem, 2019).

In my professional career I’ve had to devise an interface to a bioinformatic simulation application that I created. I had to; conduct surveys to identify the needs of our organizational users, come up with novel solutions to these needs, ideate these requirements through a rough prototypes, and then produce a final product in order to accomplish something akin to competency d. I was also able to follow up with our users to gauge the usability of the product, and make tweaks as the research went further.

My coursework in my Human Centered Design class also allowed me to explore the attributes of competency d. In my course I’ve designed user profiles, and then created requirements based upon those profiles. I then created the prototype, once the requirements were done, and afterwards generated a finished product. I was able then to asses hypothetical user evaluations of the prototype and make tweaks. My work experience, and my coursework has allowed me to embrace and fulfill all of the attributes of competency d. 

## Supporting Evidence

I have gathered two pieces of evidence that displays my knowledge of Competency D. Both pieces of evidence overlap with almost all of the attributes of the Competency. Though only one evaluates the user needs after high functioning prototype was complete.


### INFM 204 – Human Centered Design – Final Project – Link

I chose this piece of evidence because it exemplifies the entirety of Competency D. The project began with identifying hypothetical user needs in order to create an additional feature to Window’s notepad. The users needed a single button to save files from the initial menu. My group then devised the additional features, and created a wire frame model of how it should operate. A high functioning prototype, based on usability and requirements for the organization, was developed afterwards. Then a user assessment of the usability of the product took place. This piece of evidence is solid in showing my understanding of competency d.


### INFM 201 – Informatics Fundamentals – Final Project – Link 

I chose this project because it aligns quite highly to competency d. I started the project by understanding the needs of a hypothetical hospital’s library and archive that have lots of donated materials to put in a virtual museum. I then processed the requirements of the organization, then created a wire frame prototype of the interface and data design to ideate the needs to the interface. I then created a functional high fidelity prototype based on the new concepts. It stands as a very good example of competency d.

## Conclusion

This competency has taught me that user needs in a product has to be at the initial phases of an informatics project, and not an after thought. My coursework enables me to realize this concept by drafting up the requirements in the initial steps of project. I can now apply these concepts to my future interface designs for work, and research in academia. Although designing interfaces with a human centered approach is quintessential to an informaticist, one key factor that is often forgotten in designing is described by professor Abbas Moallem; "Cannot design a user experience, only design fora user experience" (Moallem, 2019).
