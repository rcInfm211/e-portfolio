## Welcome to my e-Portfolio!

My name is Randy White and this e-Portfolio serves as my culminating project for the Master of Informatics degree at San Jose State University's School of Information. This e-Portfolio contains; six areas of competency that details my mastery and learned outcomes of core areas of the program, a conclusion that includes my reflections on the Informatics program along with my strengths and professional plan for growth, and an affirmation statement that proclaims the authenticity of my e-Portfolio project. I hope you enjoy reading my project the same way I enjoyed creating it!
